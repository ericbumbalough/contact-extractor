# contact-extractor
When I created the Alumni Relations team at the [Intercooperative Council at the University of Michigan](https://icc.coop/), one of our first challenges was decades of non-standard bookkeeping.
Electronic officer directories were kept since approximately 2000, but they were stored in Word documents and the format was inconsistant over time.
I wrote MATLAB convert the Word files to .txt then search for and extract former officer names and contact info.


Please excuse the any issues with the code, it was only meant to be used once.
